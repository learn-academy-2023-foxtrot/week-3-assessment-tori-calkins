# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is a place inside a file that mixes HTML and JavaScript. In order to reference JavaScript within JSX, it needs to be held in {curly braces}, the curly braces make known to JSX that JavaScript will be used there. HTML is the backbone coding language and JSX allows there to be action. 

Researched answer: JSX stands for JavaScript syntax extension and allows developers to write HTML elements in JavaScript which converts HTML tags to react elements. HTML is its own standard markup language that was designed for web browsers and JSX allows HTML to be written inside of react by using JavaScript. 

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is a package manager that when called on will present a bunch of code snippets for the developer to use. The file thats modified is the file ending in .test.js. 

Researched answer: Yarn is one of the main JavaScript package managers used. Yarn allows developers to remove, add, and update file dependencies inside of React projects. Yarn modifies the package.json file when ran in the terminal.

3. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values are the results of a users input that is only temporarily saved and get discarded as soon as the app is refreshed. State values are stored behind the scenes. A state prop is used to reference the state value(s) and add an action that will be shown on the actual application.

Researched answer: State values are mutatable pieces of data within a component that are changed by using setState. State's job is to manage the data within a component.  While, state props are immutatable and cannot be changed within a component. Props are used to pass information from one component to another, usually a parent component to a child component.

4. What is the DOM?

Your answer: DOM stands for Document Object Model and is the physical representation of code. It is the code that appears in the users' view.

Researched answer: DOM is a representation of HTML elements that are shown on a webpage or web application and represents the UI of the application being shown. More specifically, DOM is used in React to take a user's input and the location of it and update the particular element the user is trying to change or add. 

5. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer: Div tags are used to divide and alter the text inbetween the opening and closing tags. A span tag is used to directly change/style a specific portion or word being used. 

Researched answer: Div tags are used to divide content within a code, it is used in HTML and is considered a block-level tag(take up as much space as possible within a code, multiple lines are used). Span tags are used to style inline content or elements by using class and id attributes. The main difference between div and span tags is that div is a block-level tag and span is an inline tag. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: is a computer programming model that takes objects that contain both data and methods. This is straying away from logic and functions and focusing on objects. DRY is really important here.

2. Ruby: Ruby is an object-oriented language, meaning its all about the objects.

3. Ruby blocks: uses the keywords of "do" and "end" to anonymously pass a function to a method which will determine the outcome.
